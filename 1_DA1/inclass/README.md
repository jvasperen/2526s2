# In-Class Teaching Materials - Week 1 Data Analysis

This folder contains organized, beginner-friendly Jupyter notebooks for teaching Python fundamentals to Communication Science students with **zero prior programming experience**.

## 📚 Session Overview

Each session has two versions:

- **`_SOLVED.ipynb`**: Complete with solutions, teaching notes, and tips for instructor reference

## 📖 Session Structure

### Session 1: Getting Started & Data Types
**File**: `01_GettingStarted_DataTypes`  
**Duration**: ~90 minutes  
**Topics**:
- What is Python and why use it?
- Understanding Jupyter Notebooks
- Markdown basics for documentation
- Numbers (integers and floats)
- Text (strings)
- Basic math operations

**Key Concepts**: `print()`, `type()`, data types, quotes for strings

---

### Session 2: Variables and Operations
**File**: `02_Variables_Operations`  
**Duration**: ~90 minutes  
**Topics**:
- What variables are (Python vs SPSS difference)
- Creating and using variables
- Variable naming rules
- Combining variables in operations
- Working with different data types

**Key Concepts**: Assignment `=`, variable naming, operations, `str()`, booleans

---

### Session 3: Data Structures
**File**: `03_DataStructures`  
**Duration**: ~90 minutes  
**Topics**:
- Introduction to lists
- Accessing items with indexing (0-based!)
- Modifying lists (append, insert, remove)
- Introduction to dictionaries
- Key-value pairs
- When to use lists vs dictionaries

**Key Concepts**: `[]` lists, `{}` dictionaries, indexing, keys, values

---

### Session 4: Control Flow
**File**: `04_ControlFlow`  
**Duration**: ~90 minutes  
**Topics**:
- Making decisions with if/elif/else
- Comparison and logical operators
- For loops (iterating through collections)
- While loops (repeating until condition)
- Introduction to functions
- Combining concepts

**Key Concepts**: `if/elif/else`, `for`, `while`, `def`, indentation, `return`

---

## 🎯 Teaching Approach

### For Each Session:

1. **Introduction** (5-10 min)
   - Connect to previous session
   - Preview today's topics
   - Real-world relevance (social media data, surveys, etc.)

2. **Concept + Demo** (15-20 min per major concept)
   - Explain with analogies
   - Live code demonstration
   - Show common errors

3. **Guided Practice** (10-15 min)
   - Work through exercises together
   - Students code along on their own notebooks
   - Walk around to help

4. **Independent Practice** (15-20 min)
   - Students attempt exercises individually
   - Instructor available for questions
   - Discuss solutions as a class

5. **Wrap-up** (5 min)
   - Summary of key concepts
   - Preview next session
   - Optional challenge for motivated students

## 💡 Teaching Tips

### General Advice:
- **Assume zero knowledge**: Don't skip "obvious" things
- **Encourage mistakes**: They're learning opportunities
- **Use real examples**: Social media metrics, survey data, content analysis
- **Go slow with syntax**: Quotes, commas, colons, indentation matter!
- **Live code together**: Type along with students on the projector
- **Check understanding frequently**: "Does this make sense?" isn't enough - ask specific questions

### Common Student Struggles:
- Forgetting quotes around strings
- 0-based indexing confusion
- Indentation errors
- Mixing up `=` and `==`
- While loops that never end
- Understanding when to use lists vs dictionaries

### Pacing:
- Better to cover less content well than rush through everything
- Build in buffer time for questions and troubleshooting
- Some students will go faster - have optional challenges ready
- Some will need extra help - be patient and use different explanations

## 🛠️ Setup for Class

### Before Class:
1. Test all notebooks run without errors
2. Have Jupyter Notebook/Lab running and ready
3. Share student notebooks with class (via LMS or shared folder)
4. Remind students to bring laptops with Python installed

### During Class:
1. Project the student notebook on screen
2. Keep solved notebook open on your computer for reference
3. Encourage students to take notes in markdown cells
4. Save and share your live-coded version after class

### After Class:
1. Share your annotated notebook from live session
2. Post solutions (after students have attempted exercises)
3. Collect common questions for FAQs
4. Adjust next session based on class progress

## 📊 Assessment Ideas

### Formative (During Class):
- Ask students to show you their output
- Quick polls: "Which code will work?"
- Debugging challenges: "What's wrong with this code?"
- Explain to neighbor: "Tell your partner what a variable is"

### Summative (End of Week):
- Complete a mini-analysis with provided data
- Fix broken code (debugging exercise)
- Create functions that process survey data
- Written reflection on what they learned

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

By the end of these 4 sessions, students should be able to:

✅ Write and execute basic Python code in Jupyter Notebooks  
✅ Use variables to store and manipulate data  
✅ Work with different data types (int, float, str, bool, list, dict)  
✅ Make decisions using conditional statements  
✅ Repeat actions using loops  
✅ Create simple functions to organize code  
✅ Debug common errors  
✅ Apply these skills to basic data analysis tasks
